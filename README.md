## Plugin

[google_maps_flutter](https://github.com/flutter/plugins/tree/master/packages/google_maps_flutter) from flutter team.

## Usage

To use this plugin, add
```yaml
 google_maps_flutter:
   git:
     url: git://github.com/flutter/plugins
     path: packages/google_maps_flutter
```
as a [dependency in your pubspec.yaml file](https://flutter.io/platform-plugins/).

## Getting Started

Get an API key at <https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/>.

### Android

Specify your API key in the application manifest `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<manifest ...
  <application ...
    <meta-data android:name="com.google.android.geo.API_KEY"
               android:value="YOUR KEY HERE"/>
```

### iOS

Specify your API key in the application delegate `ios/Runner/AppDelegate.m`:

#### Objective-C

```objectivec
#include "AppDelegate.h"
#include "GeneratedPluginRegistrant.h"
#import "GoogleMaps/GoogleMaps.h"

@implementation AppDelegate

- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application
    didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
  [GMSServices provideAPIKey:@"YOUR KEY HERE"];
  [GeneratedPluginRegistrant registerWithRegistry:self];
  return [super application:application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:launchOptions];
}
@end
```

#### Swift
```
import UIKit
import Flutter
import GoogleMaps

@UIApplicationMain
@objc class AppDelegate: FlutterAppDelegate {
  override func application(
    _ application: UIApplication,
    didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]?
  ) -> Bool {
    GeneratedPluginRegistrant.register(with: self)
    GMSServices.provideAPIKey("YOUR_API_KEY")
    return super.application(application, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: launchOptions)
  }
}
```

Opt-in to the embedded views preview by adding a boolean property to the app's `Info.plist` file
with the key `io.flutter.embedded_views_preview` and the value `YES`.

### Both


You can now add a `GoogleMap` widget to your widget tree.

The map view can be controlled with the `GoogleMapController` that is passed to
the `GoogleMap`'s `onMapCreated` callback.
